            <p>A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,
                identifying
                the
                goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary customers or market,
                and
                its
                geographical region of operation.

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>
                    A mission statement is a short statement of why an organization exists, what its overall goal is,
                    identifying the goal of its operations: what kind of product or service it provides, its primary
                    customers or market, and its geographical region of operation.[1][2] It may include a short
                    statement of
                    such fundamental matters as the organization's values or philosophies, a business's main competitive
                    advantages, or a desired future stateâ€”the "vision".

                <h3>Vission</h3>
                <p>
                    A vision statement is an inspirational statement of an idealistic emotional future of a company or
                    group. Vision describes the basic human emotion that a founder intends to be experienced by the
                    people
                    the organization interacts with. It grounds the group so it can actualize some existential impact on
                    the
                    world.

                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>
                    A goal is an idea of the future or desired result that a person or a group of people envision, plan
                    and
                    commit to achieve. People endeavour to reach goals within a finite time by setting deadlines.

            <p>Development is a process that creates growth, progress, positive change or the addition of physical,
                economic, environmental, social and demographic components. The purpose of development is a rise in the
                level and quality of life of the population, and the creation or expansion of local regional income and
                employment opportunities, without damaging the resources of the environment.
